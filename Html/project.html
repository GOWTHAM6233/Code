    <h3>TRADING</h3>
    <p>
      Trading is the act of buying and selling financial assets like stocks,
      bonds, or commodities. People trade to make a profit by purchasing assets
      at a low price and selling them at a higher price. Trading can be done
      through stock exchanges, where buyers and sellers meet to exchange these
      assets. The goal of trading is to take advantage of price changes in the
      market.

    <h3>INVESTMENT</h3>
    <p>
      Investment is the act of putting money into financial assets, like stocks,
      bonds, or real estate, with the expectation of earning a profit over time.
      People invest to grow their wealth and achieve financial goals, such as
      saving for retirement or buying a house. Unlike trading, which focuses on
      short-term gains, investment is generally about long-term growth and
      stability. The goal is to increase the value of the initial amount
      invested through appreciation, dividends, or interest.
